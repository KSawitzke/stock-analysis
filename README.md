# Stock Analysis


## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project was to help our friend Steve create a more efficient macro for stock analysis that he could use long term. He was pleased with the workbook we collaborated on to help his parents choose between green energy stocks, and wanted to refactor that existing code to be usable for future applications. By refactoring this code, we aimed to create a broader workbook that can be used quickly and efficiently on potentially huge numbers of stocks with large underlying trading datasets.

## Analysis

  We were able to help Steve and by extention his parents make an educated decision on their green energy stocks, even using our initial macro before refactoring it. There were huge gains seen in 2017, followed by a large drop off in 2018 with returns falling for all but two of the 12 stocks chosen to analyze. Here we can see the results across the two years of stock data based on the results of our macro compiling the data into easy-to-read tables.
